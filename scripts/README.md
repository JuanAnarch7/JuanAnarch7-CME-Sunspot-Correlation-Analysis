# Scripts Directory

This folder contains the analysis scripts used to study correlations
between CME occurrence rates and sunspot activity.

All scripts can be executed independently, provided the required
input datasets are available.

## Analysis Organization

Scripts are provided for analyses performed in both:

- Annual temporal resolution
- Monthly temporal resolution

Each script performs a specific step of the statistical analysis,
including stationarity diagnostics, correlation estimation, bootstrap
confidence intervals, and sensitivity tests.

## Inputs

Scripts expect processed CME and sunspot datasets as described in
`data/README.md`.

## Outputs

Scripts generate statistical summaries and figures used in the analysis
and publications derived from this project.

## Execution Notes

Scripts are modular and may be executed separately depending on the
analysis required.
