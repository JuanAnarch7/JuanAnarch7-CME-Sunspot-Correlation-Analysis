Statistical analysis of correlations between coronal mass ejections and sunspot activity across solar cycles.
# CME–Sunspot Correlations

Statistical analysis of the relationship between Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) occurrence rates and sunspot activity across solar cycles. This project evaluates the robustness of CME–sunspot coupling using correlation analysis, bootstrap confidence intervals, and sensitivity tests across CME velocity regimes.

The repository is designed to ensure reproducibility of results used in scientific publications and related studies.

## Project Objectives

- Quantify correlations between CME occurrence rates and sunspot numbers.
- Evaluate robustness across CME velocity subsets.
- Estimate confidence intervals via bootstrap resampling.
- Test sensitivity of correlations to data selection and filtering.
- Support reproducible solar-cycle variability studies.
